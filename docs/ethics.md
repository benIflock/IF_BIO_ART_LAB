# Ethics and Artistic Statement  
<br>

_the Bio-Art-Lab is an emergent space and practice for the studio so this document will grow with it_

This lab is created in order to create a site for greater possibilities of entaglements between artists and the living world. It is a space for creative exploration of the awe-inspiring natural world that exists beyond our human scale perceptions of scale, time and place. It does so with a deep respect for all living things and beings, both seen with our eyes and unseen.

Less than a third of the cells in our body are fully _human_ , the remaining fungi and bacteria that make us up are our own wild ecologies.

This space is an invitation to explore and draw closer to these ecologies.

We ask all participants and users of the __B-A-L__ to approach their work here in this spirit, with an eye to the material and philosophical implication of the above on your work.
