# Beer and wild ferments

### Beer is its own microbial marvel that proposes a multitude of ways of entangling the visible and invisible world around us with culture

#### basic steps:

- sanitation : cleaning all the gear
- the brewing : assuming full grain process:
	- The Mash ie activating enzymes in the grain to change starch to sugar (food for yeast) also base body/flavour/colour of beer ()
	- Lautering separating the mash from the grain, this includes sparging (heating some more water to hotter and pouring over grain) all to get maximum sugar out of the grain
	- The Boil, boiling at a higher temp to kill off remaining enzymes,  remove O2 and lower pH for stability. Hops are first added here
- Cool Down as fast as possible (room temp in 20min)
- Transfer to primary fermenter (gravity reading)
- pitch yeast and aerate
- 1st fermentation (yeast converts sugars to alcohol) 
- 2nd fermentation (if doing)
- rack
