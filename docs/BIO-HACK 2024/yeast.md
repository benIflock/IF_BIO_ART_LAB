# Yeast

## living fungus that makes beer and bread

Yeasts are eukaryotic, single cell organisms, classified as members of the fungus family.  

As a live organism that is all around us yeast needs to be wrangled and negotiated with in order to be able to function in processes like bread, beer ect..

### Wrangling wild yeast

_step 1_:
    - find the yeast - in this case on fruit (blueberries)
    - create a low gravity starter wort (recipe used - 1:5 Malt Extract to water )
    - submerge fruit leaving room for fermentation
    - shake vigorouly to aerate
    - leave in room temperature 


_step 2_:
    - extract and plate up (TD)


### Working with wild honey

Based on a mead starter - raw honey holds yeast but as long as the honey remains concentrated the yeast is dormant, but as soon as dilution begins the yeast wakes up _based on Sandor Katz Art of Fermentation_ 

- first protocol test: dillute wild ogiek honey in water using a 1:4 ratio honey:water
- leave for three days
